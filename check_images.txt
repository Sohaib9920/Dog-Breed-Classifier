Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The true label of Dog_01.jpg was norfolk terrier. Alexnet classified it wrong as norwich terrier while ResNet and VGG classified it right.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Alexnet classified both images to be same breed of dog but this classification was wrong altogether. ResNet and VGG classified both images differently. ResNet classified Dog_02.jpg as brabancon griffon which is completely wrong 
while VGG classified it as norwich terrier which is wrong but close. It shows that the inverted image has the effect on classification.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes all of models correctly classified them as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: VGG is selected because:
- It classified dog and not-dogs completely right
- Unlike Alexnet, it classified breed of Dog_01.jpeg right
- Unlike ResNet, it classified the Dog_02.jpeg close to its true label
